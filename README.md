# AdventureCreator
Adventure creature is an app for creating and playing text-based adventures, with a couple of extra nifty features.

If you have ever played a text-based adventure game or read a choose-your-own-adventure book, you'll have a good idea of the kind of experience AdventureCreator offers. We want to recreate the fun of playing these classic games, while also granting users a streamlined way to create and share adventures of their own.

On the play side, you can see all the stories currently in our database, organized by genre. Swiping left and right will flip through the books on each shelf. When you see a story that interests you, tap it and select your chapter. This will bring you to the play screen to begin your adventure!

You will immediately notice a box with some text on it that describes the first scene in the story. Below it the app will ask you "What will you do next?" You can type anything you like in this box, and AdventureCreator will try its best to match your phrase to the available actions in the scene when you tap "Proceed." If you get stumped, or if you'd just prefer to see what you can do in a scene, tap the hint button twice and you'll see a list of all available actions. Just tap your decision to see where your adventure will lead!

At any point in your story you can tap the bookmark icon to save your progress in that particular chapter. Tapping again will return you to the main screen of the app.

In the upper right an open book icon represents your journal, offering a summary of all your actions in the chapter so far.
