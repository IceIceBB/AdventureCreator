# AdventureCreator
Adventure creature is an app for creating and playing text-based adventures, with a couple of extra nifty features. 

If you have ever played a text-based adventure game or read a choose-your-own-adventure book, you'll have a good idea of the kind of experience AdventureCreator offers. We want to recreate the fun of playing these classic games, while also granting users a streamlined way to create and share adventures of their own.

Hopefully the interface is more or less intuitive, but in case you're having trouble, this page should answer any questions you might have.

#Play through a story

On the play side, you can see all the stories currently in our database, organized by genre. Swiping left and right will flip through the books on each shelf. When you see a story that interests you, tap it and select your chapter. This will bring you to the play screen to begin your adventure!

Each scene in a story will present the user with some text describing the scene, as well as a box to enter text just below. You can type anything you like into the box, and AdventureCreator will try its best to match your phrase to the available actions in the scene when you tap "Proceed." If you get stumped, or if you'd just prefer to see what you can do in a scene, tap the hint button twice and you'll see a list of all available actions. Just tap your decision to see where your adventure will lead!

At any point in your story you can tap the bookmark icon to save your progress in that particular chapter. Tapping again will return you to the main screen of the app.

In the upper right an open book icon represents your journal, offering a summary of all your actions in the chapter so far.

**Remember: if you ever forget how gameplay works, tap the help button twice to activate Help Mode, where tapping any other element on the screen will tell you exactly what that element is and does.**

#Create a story

You can think of a story or adventure in AdventureCreator as being made of one or more chapters, and each chapter is further divided into scenes.

Keep in mind that as you are creating your story, pressing back at any point will save your work so far.

If you'd like to create a game, after you tap New Story you should see a new unnamed story appear in your list. Tap on it to begin creating a brand new adventure!

![Story with details filled in]()

From the first page you can give your story a name, brief summary, genre, and tags to make it easy to find by searching. Currently AdventureCreator supports fantasy, scifi, and horror as genres. Any other genre will make your story appear in the "other" category of the library.

Once you've finalized the story details, tap New Chapter to begin working on the first chapter of your story. Similarly to when you tapped the New Story button, you will see a new unnamed chapter appear in the list, which you can tap to begin editing.

![Chapter 1 with details filled in]()

Now you can enter a name for your chapter, an overall goal to be attained within the chapter, as well as a brief summary. Once the chapter details are complete, you can get into the real meat of story creation.

![Chapter 1 with a scene added]()

Tapping New Scene Node will create a new scene which can be tapped on to edit it.

The scene creator works similarly to the previous screens, with fields for scene name, journal text (a brief description of the scene that gets added to the player's journal as he or she progresses through the story), flag modifiers, and the body text for the scene. This Scene Body Text is what will be presented to the player in the main text box.

Additionally at the top of the page, 3 radio buttons allow you to choose the type of scene you would like to create. An action node is a fairly standard scene in which
